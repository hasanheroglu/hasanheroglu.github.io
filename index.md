<!-- # Who is this? -->
Hey there stranger! I'm Hasan. I'm an adaptable, ambitious Computer Engineering graduate, soon to get an MSc. from the Technical University of Munich. I participated in exciting courses during my Master’s degree that improved my skills in the field of Software Engineering. I am interested in Software Development, Testing, and automating the development cycles. At the moment, I am working on my thesis “Private Preferences for Smart Environments based on Web of Things” using [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) and [Solid protocol](https://solidproject.org/). Here, in this page, you can see the various projects I did and contributed. You can also reach my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasanheroglu).

## Web Applications
### VOTIT
A web-based poll application I made with my peers Berk Kaan Bilir, Ilmiye Elisa Pasaoglu and Orhan Hancer for our Software Engineering (BLG411E) course at ITU. Spring Boot and React.js is used for implementation of the project.

Source code of the frontend implementation is [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/Votit-Frontend).

Source code of backend implementation is [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/Votit-Backend).

### Movie Database Web Application
A web-based movie database application I made during my internship at OBSS. Spring Boot and React.js is used for implementation of the project.

<img src="/media/moviedatabase.gif" alt="movie_database" width="650"/>

Source code of the frontend implementation is [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/MovieDatabaseApp-Frontend).

Source code of backend implementation is [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/MovieDatabaseApp-Backend).

## Computer Graphics
### Raytracer
A raytracer implementation using C++. Right now, reflection and refraction is missing but I am planning to add them as soon as possible.

In below, you can see the result I get from my raytracer.

<img src="/media/raytracer_result.png" alt="raytracer-result" width="650"/>

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/RayTracer).

Unfortunately, my implementation got out of the hand, hence I decided to follow Peter Shirley's amazing book and result is absolutely good.

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/raytracing-in-one-weekend).

### Bresenham's Line Algorithm
Bresenham's Algorithm implementation to draw triangles using C++. I just did not stop with triangles and implemented it for circles too. If I want to go further from here, it could be a start of an image manipulation program.

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/Bresenham-s-Line-Algorithm).

## Games And Prototypes
### Inventory Management System
A prototype of an inventory management system implemented by using Unity and C#. I tried to implement DayZ and Escape From Tarkov like inventory system. There are still lots of features to do like filtering, rotatable items etc. It is a basic inventory management system for now. When an item is placed in the inventory, it does not allow any other item to fit in the same place occupied by the item.

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/InventoryManagementSystem).

### Survival Simulation Game
A game I made as a graduation project. The game allows different characters to interact with the world differently. Source code is written in such way that developers can easily add new interactions, characters and objects.

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/graduationproject).
Bachelor's thesis is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/GraduationProject/blob/master/grad_files/bachelorsthesis.pdf).

### Picker
A prototype of a mobile 3D Picker game.

<img src="/media/picker3d.gif" alt="3dpicker-gif" width="650"/>

Playable on [itch.io](https://hasanheroglu.itch.io/picker-3d-prototype).

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/Picker3D).

### RunNDash
A prototype of Endless Runner type of game I made. Player have an ability of dash to dodge obstacles.

<img src="/media/runndash.gif" alt="runndash-gif" width="650"/>

Playable on [itch.io](https://hasanheroglu.itch.io/runndash).

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/runndash).

### LUP!
A puzzle game made with Unity using C#. The objective of the game is to make the ball reach to the green tile. There are 50 playable levels and customization options for your ball which affects appearance and sound effects.

Downloadable on [itch.io](https://hasanheroglu.itch.io/lupthegame).

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/hasanheroglu/LUP).

### Infiltration Game
A game we made together with my peers Chris Katsikiotis, Jesualdo Garcia and Marcus von Christensen for Introduction to Computer Game Prototyping(02823) at DTU.
